# ECommerce-Customer-Segmentation-Project
Customer Segmentation and Revenue Analysis for a Gifting Store using Python and Power BI

Unwrapping Customer Insights, Revenue, and Segmentation for a Gifting Store

Overview

This project dives into customer behavior, revenue trends, and segmentation for a UK-based online gifting store using real-world e-commerce transaction data from Kaggle. Instead of just running standard analyses, I structured the data to make sense of customer patterns, ensuring that the insights could drive actual business decisions.

Dataset Details

Source: E-commerce Data (Kaggle)

Time Period: One year of transaction data

Key Columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique order ID (prefix "C" for cancellations)

StockCode & Description: Product details

Quantity: Number of units purchased

InvoiceDate: Date & time of transaction

UnitPrice: Price per unit

CustomerID: Unique customer identifier

Country: Location of purchase

Key Highlights

âœ” Customer Segmentation: Identified loyal customers, big spenders, and frequent buyers using data-driven thresholds rather than standard percentiles.
âœ” Revenue Analysis: Evaluated seasonal trends, high-value transactions, and bulk orders to identify major revenue sources.
âœ” Cancellation Handling: Addressed the impact of high-volume canceled orders (up to 80,000 units) by filtering them thoughtfully rather than just removing them.
âœ” Data Structuring: Created a refined dataset with an OrderType column instead of dropping invoices, ensuring a balanced segmentation approach.
âœ” Power BI Dashboard: Transformed raw data into an interactive visualization to extract actionable insights efficiently.
